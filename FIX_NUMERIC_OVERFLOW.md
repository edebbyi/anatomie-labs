# Fix for "numeric field overflow" Error in Onboarding

## Problem
During the onboarding process, when generating a style profile, the system was encountering a "numeric field overflow" error. This was happening when trying to save the average confidence value to the database.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by two problems:

1. **Database Column Definition**: The `avg_confidence` column in the `style_profiles` table was defined as `DECIMAL(3,3)`, which can only store values from 0.000 to 0.999. When the average confidence was 1.0 or higher, it caused a numeric overflow.

2. **Data Type Issue**: The `calculateAvgConfidence()` function was returning a string value (due to using `toFixed(3)`) instead of a numeric value, which could cause issues when inserting into the database.

## Solution
I implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Database Migration Fix
Created a new migration file `migrations/009_fix_avg_confidence_column.sql` that changes the column definition from `DECIMAL(3,3)` to `DECIMAL(4,3)`, allowing values from 0.000 to 9.999.

### 2. Code Fix
Updated both `src/services/trendAnalysisAgent.js` and `fix_style_profile/improvedTrendAnalysisAgent.js` to return numeric values instead of strings from the calculation functions:

- Changed `calculateAvgConfidence()` to use `parseFloat()` on the result
- Changed `calculateAvgCompleteness()` to use `parseFloat()` on the result

### 3. Schema Update
Updated the original migration file `fix_style_profile/migration_enhanced_style_profiles.sql` to use the correct column definition from the start.

## Files Modified
1. `migrations/009_fix_avg_confidence_column.sql` - New migration file
2. `src/services/trendAnalysisAgent.js` - Fixed return types
3. `fix_style_profile/improvedTrendAnalysisAgent.js` - Fixed return types
4. `fix_style_profile/migration_enhanced_style_profiles.sql` - Updated column definition

## How to Apply the Fix
1. Run the new migration file:
   ```bash
   psql your_database < migrations/009_fix_avg_confidence_column.sql
   ```

2. Restart your application server

The fix should resolve the "numeric field overflow" error and allow the onboarding process to complete successfully.
