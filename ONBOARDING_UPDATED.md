# ✅ FRONTEND ONBOARDING - FULLY UPDATED!

## 🎉 Summary

The frontend onboarding flow has been **completely updated** to use the Podna agent system end-to-end. Users will now see their **first custom-generated images** immediately after uploading their portfolio!

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### ❌ OLD Flow (Agents Service - Python)
```
Upload ZIP → /api/agents/portfolio/upload
  ↓
Python agents-service analyzes
  ↓
Generates images with Imagen
  ↓
Returns images
```

**Issues:**
- Used old Python microservice
- Required separate agents-service running
- Used Imagen (different from Podna system)
- Inconsistent with backend architecture

---

### ✅ NEW Flow (Podna System - Node.js + Replicate)
```
1. Upload ZIP → POST /api/podna/upload
   ↓
   Ingestion Agent extracts & uploads to R2
   
2. Analyze → POST /api/podna/analyze/:portfolioId
   ↓
   Style Descriptor Agent (Gemini 2.5 Flash via Replicate)
   Analyzes all images, extracts fashion attributes
   
3. Generate Profile → POST /api/podna/profile/generate/:portfolioId
   ↓
   Trend Analysis Agent creates style distributions
   
4. Generate Images → POST /api/podna/generate
   ↓
   Prompt Builder Agent (epsilon-greedy bandit)
   Image Generation Agent (Stable Diffusion XL via Replicate)
   Generates 8 custom designs
   
5. Display → User sees their custom images! ✨
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Backend (Already Working)
- [x] POST /api/podna/upload - Ingestion Agent
- [x] POST /api/podna/analyze/:id - Style Descriptor Agent (Gemini via Replicate)
- [x] POST /api/podna/profile/generate/:id - Trend Analysis Agent

## 🎯 What Happens Next

After onboarding completes:

1. **User lands on `/home`**
   - Sees 8 generated images
   - Each has a prompt description
   - Can like/dislike or add critiques

2. **User can generate more**
   - Go to `/generate`
   - Select count (1-50)
   - Choose strategy (exploit/explore)
   - Get more custom designs

3. **Feedback improves results**
   - Like images → boost those attributes
   - Dislike images → reduce those attributes
   - Add text critiques → Gemini parses and adjusts
   - Next generation uses updated preferences

4. **Continuous learning loop**
   - Every feedback updates style profile
   - Prompt weights adjusted
   - Future generations improve
   - System learns user's taste
