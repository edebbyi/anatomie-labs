# Server Start Fix Summary

## Problem
The server was failing to start with the error:
```
Port 3001 is already in use. Please kill the process or use a different port.
[nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Development Script
Created a new enhanced development script that:
- Checks for processes using common development ports (3001, 5000)
- Attempts graceful termination before force killing
- Provides better error handling and logging
- Verifies ports are free before starting the server

### 2. Updated Package.json
Added a new npm script:
```bash
npm run dev:enhanced
```

### 3. Updated Existing Scripts
Modified the existing [start-dev.sh](file:///Users/esosaimafidon/Documents/GitHub/anatomie-lab/scripts/start-dev.sh) script to use the enhanced approach.

### 4. Utility Scripts
Created additional utility scripts:
- [check-ports.sh](file:///Users/esosaimafidon/Documents/GitHub/anatomie-lab/scripts/check-ports.sh) - Check what processes are using common development ports

### 5. Documentation Updates
Updated documentation to reflect the new scripts:
- README.md
- START_SERVERS.md

## Usage

To start the server with automatic port conflict resolution:
```bash
npm run dev:enhanced
```

Or use the script directly:
```bash
./scripts/start-dev.sh
```

To check what processes are using common development ports:
```bash
./scripts/check-ports.sh
```

## Benefits
- Eliminates manual process killing
- Provides better error reporting
- Reduces startup time by automating conflict resolution
- Improves developer experience
