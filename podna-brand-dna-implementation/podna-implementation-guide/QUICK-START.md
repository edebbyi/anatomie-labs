## 📖 For Code Builders

You've been given this implementation guide to add Brand DNA to the Podna system.

### What You're Building
**Brand DNA System** - Makes AI generate images that match the designer's signature style.

### How Long Will This Take?
- **Phase 1 (Critical):** 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2 (UX):** 1-2 weeks  
- **Phase 3 (Polish):** 1-2 weeks
- **Total:** 4-6 weeks for complete system

1. Implement `thompsonSampleWithBias()`
2. Update `buildDetailedPrompt()`
3. Test prompt generation

**Friday:**
1. Code review
2. Integration testing
3. Demo to team

**Deliverable:** Brand DNA extracted, prompts use brand boost

---

### Week 2: API & Generation
**Goal:** Generate with brand DNA via API

**Monday-Tuesday:**
1. Create `/generate-with-dna` endpoint
2. Update `/profile` endpoint
3. Write API tests

**Wednesday-Thursday:**
1. Test generation with brand DNA
2. Measure consistency scores
3. Tune brand boost parameters

**Friday:**
1. Load testing
2. Documentation
3. Demo actual generations

**Deliverable:** API generates on-brand images >70% of time

---

### Week 3: Frontend Display
**Goal:** User can see brand DNA

**Monday-Tuesday:**
1. Read `03-FRONTEND-IMPLEMENTATION.md`
2. Add Brand DNA display panel
3. Update prompt validation

**Wednesday-Thursday:**
1. Add brand consistency toggle
2. Show consistency badges on images
3. Test UI responsiveness

**Friday:**
1. Design review
2. User testing
3. Polish

**Deliverable:** User sees brand DNA, understands what AI learned

---

### Week 4: Frontend Control
**Goal:** User can control brand DNA

**Monday-Tuesday:**
1. Add brand strength slider
2. Implement "Generate from aesthetic" buttons
3. Add "Use as template" features

**Wednesday-Thursday:**
1. Update Style Profile page
2. Add actionable elements
3. Test user flows

**Friday:**
1. End-to-end testing
2. User acceptance testing
3. Polish

**Deliverable:** User has full control over brand enforcement

---

### Week 5-6: Optimization (Optional but Recommended)
**Goal:** Self-improving system

**Tasks:**
1. Brand drift detection
2. Profile refresh suggestions
3. Advanced Thompson tuning
4. Performance optimization

**Deliverable:** System gets better over time automatically

## 🎯 Critical Path (Can't Skip These)

### Phase 1: Must Complete
1. `extractBrandDNA()` - Without this, nothing works
2. `thompsonSampleWithBias()` - Core algorithm
3. `buildDetailedPrompt()` update - Applies brand DNA
4. `/generate-with-dna` endpoint - User-facing API

### Phase 2: High Priority  
1. Brand DNA display - User needs to see it
2. Brand consistency scores - Builds trust
3. Brand enforcement toggle - User control

### Phase 3: Nice to Have
1. Brand drift detection - Improves over time
2. Advanced controls - Power user features
3. Collaboration features - Team use cases

## 🔧 Setup Checklist

### Before You Start:
- [ ] Clone Podna repository
- [ ] Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- [ ] Setup database
- [ ] Get Replicate API key
- [ ] Verify ultra-detailed ingestion works
- [ ] Verify style profiles generate

### Verify Current System:
```bash
# Test portfolio upload
npm run test:portfolio-upload

# Test style profile generation
npm run test:style-profile

# Verify Thompson Sampling exists
grep -r "thompsonSample" src/
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Not sure where to start"
**Solution:** Start with `extractBrandDNA()` in `02-BACKEND-IMPLEMENTATION.md` Section 1.1

### Issue: "Tests are failing"
**Solution:** Check `05-TESTING-GUIDE.md` Section 1 for unit test examples

### Issue: "Brand consistency scores too low"
**Solution:** Tune `brandBoost` parameter in `thompsonSampleWithBias()`, try 1.5 → 2.0

### Issue: "UI doesn't show brand DNA"
**Solution:** Check API response includes `brandDNA` field, verify frontend state management

### Issue: "System not learning from feedback"
**Solution:** Verify `feedbackLearnerAgent` is updating Thompson parameters
