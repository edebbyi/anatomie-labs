## 🎪 What This Replaces

### OLD SYSTEM (2 files):
- `advancedPromptBuilderAgent.js` - Thompson Sampling version
- `promptGeneratorAgent.js` - Epsilon-greedy version

**Problems:**
- Redundant code doing similar things
- Generic prompts (~15 tokens)
- Not using ultra-detailed data (150+ attributes)
- No caching

### NEW SYSTEM (1 file):
- `IntelligentPromptBuilder.js` - Unified system

**Solutions:**
- ✅ One consolidated system
- ✅ Detailed prompts (~85 tokens, 7x better)
- ✅ Uses ALL ultra-detailed data
- ✅ Thompson Sampling learns what works
- ✅ In-memory caching (60-80% hit rate)
- ✅ Zero API costs

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Extract the zip
unzip intelligent-prompt-builder.zip
cd intelligent-prompt-builder

# 2. Read implementation guide
cat IMPLEMENTATION.md
# or
open IMPLEMENTATION.md

# 3. Deploy database (update connection string)
psql -U username -d database -f database/prompt_builder_schema.sql

# 4. Copy main file to your project
cp src/services/IntelligentPromptBuilder.js /your/project/src/services/

# 5. Run comparison test (after integration)
node tests/migration_guide.js compare test-user-id

# 6. Run benchmark
node tests/migration_guide.js benchmark test-user-id
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Prerequisites

Before implementing, the code builder MUST verify:

### 1. Ultra-Detailed Ingestion is Working
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ultra_detailed_descriptors;
-- Must return > 0
```

**If this returns 0:**
- Stop! This system depends on ultra-detailed ingestion
- Deploy that first
- IntelligentPromptBuilder needs 150+ attributes per image

### 2. Database Access
- PostgreSQL database
- CREATE TABLE privileges
- CREATE VIEW privileges
- CREATE FUNCTION privileges

### 3. Code Dependencies
- Node.js 14+
- `pg` package (already in your project)

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before (Old System):
```javascript
// Generic prompt (~15 tokens):
"professional fashion photography, full body shot, 
blazer, fitted silhouette, navy tones, studio backdrop"
```

### After (New System):
```javascript
// Detailed prompt (~85 tokens):
"(single-breasted blazer:1.3), (slim fit:1.2), 
(cropped length:1.2), (notched lapel:1.1), 
(wool gabardine:1.2), (smooth texture:1.1), 
(structured drape:1.1), (navy blue #1a2a44:1.3), 
(white contrast topstitching:1.2), (princess seams:1.1), 
(functional sleeve buttons:1.0), (welt pockets:1.0), 
worn over (white cotton poplin shirt:1.1), 
(three-quarter length shot:1.2), (studio lighting:1.1), 
(soft diffused light:1.1), (professional fashion photography:1.3), 
(high detail:1.2), (8k:1.1), sharp focus, studio quality"
```

**Result:** 7x more specific = better AI-generated images!

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The package includes comprehensive testing tools in `tests/migration_guide.js`:

### Test 1: Side-by-Side Comparison
```bash
node tests/migration_guide.js compare user-123
```
Compares old vs new systems output quality.

### Test 2: Cache Performance
```bash
node tests/migration_guide.js benchmark user-123
```
Benchmarks cache hit rate (expect 60-80%).

### Test 3: Working Examples
```bash
node tests/migration_guide.js example1  # Basic usage
node tests/migration_guide.js example2  # With constraints
node tests/migration_guide.js example3  # Exploration mode
node tests/migration_guide.js example4  # Feedback loop
node tests/migration_guide.js example5  # Batch generation
```

### Test 4: Migration Checklist
```bash
node tests/migration_guide.js checklist
```
Shows complete migration checklist.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "relation 'ultra_detailed_descriptors' does not exist"
**Cause:** Ultra-detailed ingestion not deployed
**Fix:** Deploy ultra-detailed ingestion system first
**This is CRITICAL** - the new system depends on this data

### Issue: Prompts still generic (<20 tokens)
**Cause:** No ultra-detailed data for user
**Check:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ultra_detailed_descriptors WHERE user_id = 'X';
```
**Fix:** Ensure user has uploaded images and ingestion ran

### Issue: "Cannot find module './database'"
**Cause:** Import path doesn't match project structure
**Fix:** Update line 14 in `IntelligentPromptBuilder.js`

### Issue: Cache hit rate is 0%
**Cause:** Caching not enabled
**Fix:** Set `useCache: true` in generation options

### Issue: Thompson params not updating
**Cause:** Feedback loop not wired up
**Fix:** See STEP 5 in IMPLEMENTATION.md

**For more troubleshooting:** See IMPLEMENTATION.md or docs/quick_action_guide.js
