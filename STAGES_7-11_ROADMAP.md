## Next Steps

**Option A: Build Sequentially**
Start with Stage 7, complete it, test, then move to Stage 8, etc.

**Option B: Build in Parallel**
Build foundational pieces of all stages, then complete each.

**Option C: Build by Value**
Pick highest-value features from each stage first.

**Recommendation:** **Option A** - Build sequentially for solid foundation.
