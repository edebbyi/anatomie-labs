export const agentsAPI = {
  // Portfolio analysis
  analyzePortfolio: (designerId, imageUrls) => Promise<StyleProfile>,
  getStyleProfile: (designerId) => Promise<StyleProfile>,
  
  // Image generation
  generateImage: (designerId, prompt, options) => Promise<GenerationResult>,
  getBatchStatus: (batchId) => Promise<BatchStatus>,
  
  // Feedback system
  submitFeedback: (feedbackArray) => Promise<void>,
  submitSimpleFeedback: (imageId, designerId, action) => Promise<void>,
  
  // System health
  health: () => Promise<HealthStatus>,
  isAvailable: () => Promise<boolean>,
  
  // Complete workflows
  completeOnboarding: (designerId, imageUrls) => Promise<StyleProfile>,
  generateWithFallback: (designerId, prompt, options) => Promise<any>
}
```

### Navigation Integration
- New navigation items in Layout component:
  - **AI Onboarding**: Portfolio analysis and profile creation
  - **AI Generation**: Advanced AI-powered design generation  
  - **AI Feedback**: Quality rating and preference learning

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates during analysis and generation
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## 🔄 Service Integration Points

### Portfolio Analysis Flow
```
User Uploads Images → Visual Analyst Agent → Style Profile → Local Storage → UI Updates
```

### Generation Flow
```

```

### Feedback Flow
```
User Ratings → Quality Curator Agent → Model Training → Improved Future Generations
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Fallbacks
