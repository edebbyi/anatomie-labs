## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- Added `status` column
- Added `error_message` column
- Added `settings`, `metadata`, `pipeline_data` JSONB columns
- Added `cost` column for cost tracking
- Added `completed_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- Created performance indexes

### 2. ID Generation ✅
- Changed from custom string format to proper UUID v4
- Now compatible with database UUID columns

### 3. Module Dependencies ✅
- Fixed missing `promptGeneratorAgent` module
- Updated to use `IntelligentPromptBuilder`
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks

### 4. Prompt Generation ✅
- Integrated with `IntelligentPromptBuilder`
- Supports style profile integration
- Handles user modifiers correctly
- Graceful fallback when style profile unavailable

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### User Flow
1. User types command in voice command bar
2. Frontend calls `/api/generate/generate` endpoint
3. Backend validates request
4. Creates generation record in database
5. Generates prompt using `IntelligentPromptBuilder`
6. Routes to Google Imagen 4 Ultra
7. Generates high-quality image
8. Uploads to Cloudflare R2 CDN
9. Returns signed CDN URL to frontend
10. Frontend displays generated image

### Technical Flow
```
Voice Command Bar (Home.tsx)
    ↓
POST /api/generate/generate
    ↓
generationService.generateFromQuery()
    ↓
IntelligentPromptBuilder.generatePrompt()
    ↓
imagenAdapter.generate()
    ↓
Replicate API (Imagen 4 Ultra)
    ↓
Upload to R2 CDN
    ↓
Store in generation_assets table
    ↓
Return CDN URL to frontend
```
