# Numeric Overflow Workaround

## Issue
The onboarding process is failing with a "numeric field overflow" error when trying to insert values into the `avg_confidence` and `avg_completeness` columns in the `style_profiles` table.

## Root Cause Analysis
From our debugging, we can see that:
1. The `avg_confidence` column is defined as `DECIMAL(4,3)` which can hold values 0.000 to 9.999
2. The `avg_completeness` column is defined as `DECIMAL(5,2)` which can hold values 0.00 to 999.99
3. However, the actual values being calculated may exceed these ranges or may not be properly formatted

## Workaround Solution
Since we cannot directly modify the database schema, we'll implement a workaround in the application code that:

1. Properly validates and formats all numeric values before database insertion
2. Uses more appropriate data types in memory that can handle larger ranges
3. Converts values to the appropriate scale before insertion

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Validation in Code
We've added extensive validation and debugging to:
- Log all values being processed
- Check for NaN or invalid values
- Clamp values to appropriate ranges
- Format values correctly before database insertion

### 2. Value Transformation
Instead of storing raw confidence scores and percentages, we'll:
- Store confidence as a scaled value (0-1000 instead of 0-1)
- Store completeness as a scaled value (0-10000 instead of 0-100)
- Convert these values back when reading from the database

### 3. Database Insertion Strategy
We'll modify the insertion logic to:
- Scale values appropriately before insertion
- Add additional validation to prevent overflow
- Log detailed information about values being inserted

## Files Modified
1. `src/services/trendAnalysisAgent.js` - Enhanced validation and logging
2. `debug_numeric_values.js` - Debug script to test value formatting
3. `FIX_NUMERIC_OVERFLOW_WORKAROUND.md` - This document

## Next Steps
1. Test the enhanced validation with actual data
2. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
3. If the issue persists, consider implementing a more comprehensive workaround
