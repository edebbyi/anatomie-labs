```

---

## üöÄ Setup & Deployment

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Run Stage 9 migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/004_stage9_coverage_tracking.sql
```

This creates:
- Coverage reports table
- Attribute gaps table
- DPP selection results table
- Coverage config table
- Views and triggers

### 2. Register API Routes

Add to your Express app:

```javascript
const coverageRoutes = require('./routes/coverageRoutes');
app.use('/api/coverage', coverageRoutes);
```

### 3. Integrate DPP Selection (Optional Manual Step)

The updated `filterAndReturnBestImages` method is in:
- `src/services/stage9_filter_update.js`

To integrate:
1. Review the updated method
2. Replace lines 624-733 in `src/services/generationService.js`
3. Or manually integrate the DPP selection logic

The imports are already added to `generationService.js`.

### 4. Configure Environment (Optional)

```env
# Coverage targets
COVERAGE_TARGET_GARMENT_TYPE=80
COVERAGE_TARGET_SILHOUETTE=75
COVERAGE_TARGET_FABRICATION=70

# DPP parameters
DPP_RBF_SIGMA=1.0
DPP_QUALITY_WEIGHT=0.6
DPP_DIVERSITY_WEIGHT=0.4

# Gap tracking
GAP_TRACKING_ENABLED=true
AUTO_BOOST_ENABLED=true
MAX_BOOST_MULTIPLIER=3.0
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Generate images** with over-generation buffer
2. **Check coverage report**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/coverage/generation/{generationId}
   ```

3. **View active gaps**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/coverage/gaps
   ```

4. **Check gap statistics**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/coverage/summary
   ```

### Verify DPP Selection

Query the database:
```sql
SELECT 
  generation_id,
  diversity_score,
  selected_count,
  avg_coverage
FROM dpp_selection_results
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Verify Gap Tracking

```sql
SELECT 
  attribute,
  severity,
  current_coverage,
  target_coverage,
  status
FROM active_attribute_gaps;
```

---

## üìà Expected Results

### Diversity Metrics

- **Diversity Score**: 0.75 - 0.90 (excellent)
- **Avg Coverage**: 70% - 85% across attributes
- **Gap Count**: Decreasing over time as boosts are applied

### Performance

- **DPP Selection**: ~1-2 seconds for 110 ‚Üí 100 selection
- **Coverage Analysis**: <200ms
- **API Response Times**: <100ms for most endpoints

### Example Output

```json
{
  "diversityScore": 0.82,
  "avgCoverage": "75.3",
  "gaps": [
    {
      "attribute": "garmentType",
      "severity": "high",
      "currentCoverage": 75.0,
      "targetCoverage": 80.0,
      "uncoveredValues": ["jumpsuit", "set"],
      "recommendedBoost": 1.2
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "status": "Needs Improvement",
    "message": "Coverage at 75.3% with 2 gaps identified..."
  }
}
```

## üîß Integration Points

### Stage 4 Integration

To enable automatic weight adjustment, add to Stage 4 (Prompt Enhancement/Routing):

```javascript
const gapService = require('./gapAwarePromptService');

// Before generating images
const { weights, appliedBoosts } = await gapService.getAdjustedWeights();

// Adjust prompt if gaps exist
const adjusted = await gapService.adjustPromptForGaps(enhancedPrompt, vltSpec);

// Use adjusted.prompt and weights in generation
```

### Stage 8 Integration

Stage 9 receives validated images from Stage 8:

```javascript
// Stage 8: Validation complete
const validatedAssets = [...];

// Stage 9: DPP selection + coverage
const selectedAssets = await filterAndReturnBestImages(
  generationId,
  validatedAssets,
  requestedCount,
  targetSpec
);
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Queries

**Coverage Trends (Last 30 Days)**
```sql
SELECT * FROM coverage_trends
WHERE date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

**Active Critical Gaps**
```sql
SELECT * FROM active_attribute_gaps
WHERE severity = 'critical'
ORDER BY gap_percentage DESC;
```

**Gap Resolution Rate**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'resolved')::float / 
  NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0) * 100 as resolution_rate
FROM attribute_gaps
WHERE identified_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### Dashboard Metrics

Track these in your monitoring:
1. Diversity score trend
2. Gap count by severity
3. Coverage improvement rate
4. Weight boost effectiveness
5. DPP selection performance

---

## üéì How It Works

### DPP Selection Algorithm

1. **Convert images to feature vectors** using VLT attributes
2. **Build kernel matrix**:
   - Diagonal = quality scores
   - Off-diagonal = RBF similarity
3. **Greedy sampling**: Iteratively select images that maximize:
   ```
   marginal_gain = quality * 0.6 - diversity_penalty * 0.4
   ```

### Coverage Analysis

1. **Extract distribution** of each attribute across selected images
2. **Calculate metrics**:
   - Coverage % = covered values / total values
   - Entropy = Shannon entropy for uniformity
   - Gini = inequality measure
3. **Identify gaps**: Compare coverage to targets
4. **Generate recommendations**: Boost multipliers for gaps

### Gap-Based Feedback Loop

1. **Stage 9 identifies gaps** after each generation
2. **Gaps stored in DB** with severity and recommended boosts
3. **Stage 4 reads active gaps** before next generation
4. **Weights adjusted** to emphasize missing attributes
5. **Next generation** produces more diverse results
6. **Gaps gradually resolved** as coverage improves

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Generation Service Integration

The file `src/services/stage9_filter_update.js` contains the updated `filterAndReturnBestImages` method with Stage 9 integration. To complete the integration:

1. **Backup is already created**: `generationService.js.backup`
2. **Imports are added**: DPP and coverage services imported
3. **Helper method added**: `storeDPPResults()` method created
4. **Manual step required**: Replace the filtering method (lines 624-733)

The updated method:
- Validates all images (Stage 8)
- Filters acceptable quality images
- Applies DPP selection for diversity
- Runs coverage analysis
- Stores results and gaps
- Returns diverse subset to user

### Database Requirements

- PostgreSQL 12+ (for JSONB, UUID, triggers)
- Extensions: `uuid-ossp` (for UUID generation)

### Performance Considerations

- DPP is O(n¬≤k) - may be slow for very large batches
- Consider stricter validation to reduce input size
- Cache is intentionally minimal (data changes frequently)

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced DPP**:
   - Exact DPP sampling (vs. greedy approximation)
   - Learned similarity metrics via ML
   - Multi-objective optimization

2. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - ML model to predict future gaps
   - Proactive weight adjustments
   - Seasonal trend forecasting

3. **Visualization**:
   - Real-time dashboard
   - Interactive gap explorer
   - Coverage heatmaps

4. **A/B Testing**:
   - Test different DPP parameters
   - Compare selection strategies
   - Measure impact on user satisfaction
